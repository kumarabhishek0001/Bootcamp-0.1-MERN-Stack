# Javascript
Browser understands HTMl, CSS, Javascript and Web Assembly only.


- ## Javascript is Interpreted language.
It is executed line by line.
**Upside**
One less step before running the code

**Cons**
Performance overhead.
Checks are re-run every time program is executed

- ## It is dynamically Typed.
Data types of variable can change. If a variable once held Integer value lated it can also so any other data type. This is not possible in *statically Typed* language.

- ## Javascript is single threaded.
Executes in single threaded environment.

- ## Garbage Collected.
Varible takes some space in RAM. If some variable is not needed that variable should be discardded from the ram.
- It makes JS slow.
